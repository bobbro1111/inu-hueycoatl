inubot: The Ultimate Hueycoatl Automation Script
Welcome to the official repository for bob-hueycoatl, an advanced automation script designed to conquer the Hueycoatl boss with unparalleled efficiency and reliability. Built on the inubot framework, this script is engineered to handle every aspect of the fight, from the initial quest to final victory, ensuring a seamless and profitable experience.

Key Features  
***Automatic Equipment Restocking:*** The script intelligently detects when your gear is degraded or consumed. It will automatically restock and repair your equipment, minimizing downtime between runs and ensuring you're always prepared for the next fight.

***Instancing and Hosting***: Whether you're a solo adventurer or running a team, the script can automatically enter a private instance and can even be configured for hosting, allowing it to manage a queue of players for group encounters.

***Smart Thrall Utilization:*** To maximize damage per second, inubot seamlessly integrates thralls into its attack rotation. It will summon thralls at optimal times to provide a significant boost to your overall damage output.

***Special Attack Weaponry:*** The script has a sophisticated special attack logic. It will intelligently choose the best moment to unleash a special attack from your equipped weapon, ensuring the highest DPS and shorten the duration of each fight.

***Supplies Restocking:*** Before each run, the script will automatically restock your inventory with the required supplies, including food, potions, and runes. The script is highly customizable, allowing you to specify your preferred supplies and quantities.
