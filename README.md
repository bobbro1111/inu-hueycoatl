bob-hueycoatl: The Ultimate Automation Script
Welcome to the official repository for bob-hueycoatl, an advanced automation script designed to conquer complex, repetitive in-game challenges with unparalleled efficiency and reliability. Engineered as a sophisticated agent with a state machine, this script is designed to handle every aspect of a repetitive task, from initial setup to final completion, ensuring a seamless and profitable experience.

Core Features
Dynamic Inventory Management: The agent intelligently detects when your resources are degraded or consumed. It will automatically restock and repair your equipment, minimizing downtime between runs and ensuring you're always prepared for the next task.

Instance and Queue Management: Whether you're a solo user or managing a team, the script can automatically enter a private instance and can even be configured for hosting, allowing it to manage a queue of users for group encounters.

Optimized Resource Utilization: To maximize efficiency, the agent seamlessly integrates auxiliary units into its attack rotation. It will summon these units at optimal times to provide a significant boost to your overall output.

Specialized Logic for High-Impact Actions: The script has a sophisticated logic for executing special attacks or high-impact actions. It will intelligently choose the best moment to unleash these actions, ensuring the highest rate of output and shortening the duration of each run.

Advanced Resource Conservation: A core feature of the agent is its ability to perform perfect timing-based actions. This advanced technique allows the script to maintain near-infinite resources, negating the need for constant consumption and significantly reducing trip costs.

Intelligent Pathing and Hazard Avoidance: The script features a smart pathing algorithm that allows it to react instantly to environmental hazards. It can dodge projectiles, avoid ground-based attacks, and navigate the arena safely, preventing unnecessary downtime.

Supply Chain Automation: Before each run, the script will automatically restock your inventory with the required supplies, including consumables and components. The script is highly customizable, allowing you to specify your preferred supplies and quantities.

Prerequisite Completion: For new setups, the agent can handle the entire prerequisite quest automatically, ensuring you meet all the requirements for the encounter without any manual effort.
